# Dinosaurs and Santas
This riddle was created by [carykh](https://www.youtube.com/@carykh) and is taken from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_ii8QT7zsk) great video of his. It is an adapted version of a famous riddle sometimes called the "Lion and Wildebeest" riddle or the "River Crossing" riddle.

The video motivated me to find a solution using Answer Set Programming.

## The Riddle

There are three Santas and three dinosaurs on one side of a river and they all are trying to cross to the other side of this river.
None of these creatures can swim, so they have to use a raft that can hold **up to two creatures** (three or more of any type will cause it to sink). So the raft could be steered by two Santas, one Santa, two dinosaurs, one dinosaur or one of each.

With **no creatures** on board, the raft **cannot cross the river** because there is no one to steer it.

Furthermore, the dinosaurs have a biological urge to eat humans: if the ***dinosaurs outnumber the Santas** on either side of the river at any point in their journey, the dinosaurs can't help but **eat the Santa**.

This is true even if it only happens for an instant during a raft transfer.

The goal of this puzzle is to find a sequence of raft transfers so that every creature (dinosaurs and Santas) gets **unharmed** to the other side. No creature should be left stranded and no Santa should be eaten.
